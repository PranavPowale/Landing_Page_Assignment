          <p>I am a Front End developer and currently in my 3rd year pursuing my B. Tech + MBA degree in Computer Science through NMIMS Navi Mumbai. The scripting languages I know and in which I code are C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. For scripting these languages, I use Visual Studio Code. </p>

          <p>
            I have contributed in some projects like - RMX Voice Assistant: It was made on the idea of Microsoft's Cortana and is more functional than Cortana. I have also made a chatbot for a sample Facebook page using Google's Dialogflow. I am also familiar with UI/UX, and the tools I used for it were Balsamic Wireframes and Figma.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have received certifications from various educational organisations such as 'Getting Started with AWS Machine Learning' from Coursera, 'Python Programming' from Udemy and Kaggle, 'Chatbot Development' from Udemy. Also I got silver medal in Python in Hackerrank.
